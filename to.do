(this toolchain needs a lot of work.)

(need to map source metasites to their scrapers/parsers)

(first of all, there needs to be a way to map the urls of the
 projects to the search names, actually that exists, but it needs
 to be incorporated.  maybe we can use a freekbs2 domain to do all
 of this)

(then, there needs to be a way to map those names to the download
 directories that are generated from auditing-download.  Actually
 the directory names and file names suffice, but again the
 mapping has to be extracted.)

(Then we need a way to map those extracted files to the external
 dirs they get assigned.)

(we also have to fix the -y bugs in packager)

(should also automate the extraction of the readme information)

(then need to generate a lot of packages)

(add all metasites to bytelibrary)

(need to commit and push bytelibrary modifications)

(then need to work on the packager architecture, get it working more automatedly)

(also need to back the f up out of everything, and track the
 repos and have contingency plans in case of hardware failure)

(need to track the names of hard drives and what data and git
 repos are on them)
